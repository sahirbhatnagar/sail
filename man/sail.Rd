\arguments{
\item{x}{input matrix of dimension \code{n x p}, where \code{n} is the number
of subjects and p is number of X variables. Each row is an observation
vector. Can be a high-dimensional (n < p) matrix. Can be a user defined
design matrix of main effects only (without intercept) if
\code{expand=FALSE}}

\item{y}{response variable. For \code{family="gaussian"} should be a 1 column
matrix or numeric vector. For \code{family="binomial"}, should be a 1
column matrix or numeric vector with -1 for failure and 1 for success.}

\item{e}{exposure or environment vector. Must be a numeric vector. Factors
must be converted to numeric.}

\item{basis}{user defined basis expansion function. This function will be
applied to every column in \code{x}. Specify \code{function(i) i} if no
expansion is desired. Default: \code{function(i) splines::bs(i, df = 5)}.}

\item{strong}{Flag specifying strong hierarchy (TRUE) or weak hierarchy
(FALSE). Default FALSE.}

\item{group.penalty}{group lasso penalty. Can be one of \code{"gglasso"}
(group lasso), \code{"grMCP"} (group MCP) or \code{"grSCAD"} (group SCAD).
See references for details. Default: \code{"gglasso"}.}

\item{family}{response type. See \code{y} for details. Currently only
\code{family = "gaussian"} is implemented. Default: \code{"gaussian"}.}

\item{center.x}{should the columns of \code{x} (after basis expansion) be
centered (logical). Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{center.e}{should exposure variable \code{e} be centered. Default:
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{expand}{should \code{basis} be applied to every column of \code{x}
(logical). Set to \code{FALSE} if you want a user defined main effects
design matrix. If \code{FALSE} the \code{group} membership argument must
also be supplied. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{group}{a vector of consecutive integers, starting from 1, describing
the grouping of the coefficients. Only required when \code{expand=FALSE}.}

\item{weights}{observation weights, a vector of size n.
Default is 1 for each observation.}

\item{penalty.factor}{separate penalty factors can be applied to each
coefficient. This is a number that multiplies lambda to allow differential
shrinkage. Can be 0 for some variables, which implies no shrinkage, and
that variable is always included in the model. Default is 1 for all
variables. Must be of length \code{1 + 2*ncol(x)} where the first entry
corresponds to the penalty.factor for \code{e}, the next \code{ncol(x)}
entries correspond to main effects, and the following \code{ncol(x)}
entries correspond to the interactions.}

\item{lambda.factor}{the factor for getting the minimal lambda in the lambda
sequence, where \code{min(lambda) = lambda.factor * max(lambda)}.
\code{max(lambda)} is the smallest value of lambda for which all
coefficients are zero. The default depends on the relationship between
\code{N} (the number of rows in the matrix of predictors) and \code{q} (the
total number of predictors in the design matrix - including interactions).
If \code{N > q}, the default is \code{1e-4}, close to zero. If \code{N <
p}, the default is \code{0.01}. A very small value of lambda.factor will
lead to a saturated fit.}

\item{lambda}{a user supplied lambda sequence. Typically, by leaving this
option unspecified users can have the program compute its own lambda
sequence based on \code{nlambda} and \code{lambda.factor}. Supplying a
value of lambda overrides this. It is better to supply a decreasing
sequence of lambda values than a single (small) value, if not, the program
will sort user-defined lambda sequence in decreasing order automatically.
Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{alpha}{the mixing tuning parameter, with \eqn{0<\alpha<1}. It controls
the penalization strength between the main effects and the interactions.
The penalty is defined as \deqn{\lambda(1-\alpha)(w_e|\beta_e|+ \sum w_j
||\beta_j||_2) + \lambda\alpha(\sum w_{je} |\gamma_j|)}Larger values of
\code{alpha} will favor selection of main effects over interactions.
Smaller values of \code{alpha} will allow more interactions to enter the
final model. Default: \code{0.5}}

\item{nlambda}{the number of lambda values. Default: 100}

\item{thresh}{convergence threshold for coordinate descent. Each
coordinate-descent loop continues until the change in the objective
function after all coefficient updates is less than \code{thresh}. Default:
\code{1e-04}.}

\item{fdev}{minimum fractional change in deviance for stopping path. Default:
\code{1e-5}.}

\item{maxit}{maximum number of outer-loop iterations allowed at fixed lambda
value. If models do not converge, consider increasing \code{maxit}.
Default: 1000.}

\item{dfmax}{limit the maximum number of variables in the model. Useful for
very large \code{q} (the total number of predictors in the design matrix -
including interactions), if a partial path is desired. Default: \code{2 * p
+ 1} where p is the number of columns in \code{x}.}

\item{verbose}{display progress. Can be either 0,1 or 2. 0 will not display
any progress, 2 will display very detailed progress and 1 is somewhere in
between. Default: 1.}

\description{
Function to fit the Sparse Additive Interaction Model with
  strong heredity for a sequence of tuning parameters. This is a penalized
  regression method that ensures the interaction term is non-zero only if its
  corresponding main-effects are non-zero. This model only considers the
  interactions between a single exposure (E) variable and a high-dimensional
  matrix (X). Additive (non-linear) main effects and interactions can be
  specified by the user. This can also be seen as a varying-coefficient
  model.
}
\details{
The objective function for \code{family="gaussian"} is \deqn{RSS/2n
  + \lambda(1-\alpha)(w_e|\beta_e|+ \sum w_j ||\beta_j||_2) +
  \lambda\alpha(\sum w_{je} |\gamma_j|)} where \code{RSS} is the residual sum
  of squares and \code{n} is the number of observations. See Bhatnagar et al.
  (2018+) for details.

  It is highly recommended to specify \code{center.x = TRUE} and
  \code{center.e = TRUE} for both convergence and interpretation reasons. If
  centered, the final estimates can be interpreted as the effect of the
  predictor on the response while holding all other predictors at their mean
  value. For computing speed reasons, if models are not converging or running
  slow, consider increasing \code{thresh}, decreasing \code{nlambda}, or
  increasing \code{lambda.factor} before increasing \code{maxit}. Then try
  increasing the value of \code{alpha} (which translates to more penalization
  on the interactions).

  By default, \code{sail} uses the group lasso penalty on the basis
  expansions of \code{x}. To use the group MCP and group SCAD penalties (see
  Breheny and Huang 2015), the \code{grpreg} package must be installed.

Description: Sparse Additive Interaction Learning with the strong heredity property, i.e., 
    an interaction is selected only if its corresponding main effects are also included. 
    Fits a linear model with non-linear interactions via penalized maximum likelihood. 
    Interactions are limited to a single exposure or environment variable. 
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
